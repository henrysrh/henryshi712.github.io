               My name's Henry Shi. I am currently a bachelor's student at SYSU majoring in Business Administration.  I am passionate about political economy, international economics and cultural economy, particularly interested in how democratic institutions, elections, cultural values, and global economic flows shape public policy, long-term 
                development and national preference. I seek to explore the institutional foundations of
 prosperity and contribute to evidence-based policymaking in an increasingly interconnected world.
                I have taken part in marketing/industry/policy research, rich internship experiences prepare me adequate skills for diversified work scenarios.
I also attended several research projects about economic policy, collecting data and conducting in-depth research, which gives me a deeper understanding of economic applications at the societal level.
At present stage I'm seeking for 2026 master's degree in US/EU/HK. I want to improve my academic ability through master's degree study, so that I can better adapt to the requirements of my future PhD applications. 
As an outgoing and insightful youth, I'm welcome to connections and any sharing! IMPROVE BY LEARNING MORE!
